  Nike Website Clone 🏆
</a>


### Overview 🌟

This is my **first project** where I've created a Nike website clone using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. The project showcases a static version of the Nike website with a clean and modern design, reflecting the brand's aesthetic. Although it's not responsive yet, it highlights my initial efforts in web development and my ability to recreate a popular brand's site from scratch.

### Features ✨

- **Header with Nike Logo:** Includes a prominent Nike logo on the heading for brand recognition.
- **Static Layout:** A fixed design layout mimicking the look and feel of Nike's website.
- **Stylish Components:** Utilizes CSS to achieve a sleek, modern look with various styling techniques.

### Technologies Used 💻

- **HTML** for the structure
- **CSS** for styling and layout

- **JavaScript** for any dynamic interactions

### Future Improvements 🚀

- **Responsiveness:** Plan to make the site fully responsive to ensure it looks great on all devices.
- **Interactive Features:** Add more dynamic elements and interactivity to enhance user experience.

Feel free to explore the project and see how I brought the Nike brand's visual style to life! 🌐
